Project goal is to create a script that generates a calendar heatmap from several sources,
similar to the contribution calendar displayed on GitHub profiles. Edit/contribution data
would be scraped or downloaded from several online platforms and converted to a standard
format for processing. This would be used to visualize trends in contribution activity across
platforms, and be a product to display on my personal website.
The output would be an image, either an SVG or a set of static images. Below the
calendar would be toggles to turn individual sources on or off. If possible, the script could
be run daily or hourly on a server to update the image and upload it to the website.
The target data sources would be GitHub (edits), OpenStreetMap (changesets), eBird
(checklists), iNaturalist (observations), and Wikipedia or other Mediawiki sites (edits).
